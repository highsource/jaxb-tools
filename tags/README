This is the /tags directory of the `maven-jaxb2-plugin' Subversion repository.

Subdirectories of this directory are stable snapshots; they may be
named copies of particular trunk revisions, or they may be assembled
from various revisions.  Either way, a tag is generally not changed
after it is created; if it is changing, consider putting it in
/branches instead.

When a tag is no longer needed, it may be deleted.
