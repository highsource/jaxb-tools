================================== assignment ==================================
AssignedBy
==========
An identifier for the party assigning a piece of metadata. This can be a
string that designates the party informally (for example, a person's name),
or a pointer in the form a fragment identifier consisting of a # character
followed by the Duid of a Topic corresponding to the party.

Importance
==========
An indication of the importance the party assigning a piece of metadata
attaches to it. The value of the Importance attribute is a formal name for a
level of importance. Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a
controlled vocabulary.

Confidence
==========
An indication of the confidence with which a piece of metadata has been
assigned. The value of the Confidence attribute is a formal name for a
degree of confidence. Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a
controlled vocabulary.

HowPresent
==========
An indication of the way in which a piece of metadata applies. The value of
the HowPresent attribute is a formal name for the way the metadata applies.
Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a controlled vocabulary.

DateAndTime
===========
The date and (optionally) time at which a piece of metadata was assigned. 

Uses the format CCYYMMDDTHHMMSS{+or-}HHMM (century, year, month, day, time
separator, hours, minutes, seconds, timezone separator, hours, minutes). If
only the Date is needed, then the substring from T onwards may be omitted.

This is the Basic Format defined by ISO 8601. CCYY is a 4-digit year number.
MM is a 2-digit month number. DD is a 2-digit day number. T is the letter 'T'.
HH is a 2-digit hour number (using a 24-hour clock). MM is a 2 digit minute
number. (Note that midnight may be represented as 240000 on the date
of the day that is ending, or as 000000 on the date of the day that is
beginning.)

{+or-} is the '+' character or the '-' character, and the following HHMM are
hours and minutes of offset from Universal Co-ordinated Time (UTC) as defined
by ISO 8601. If the time is being expressed in UTC, then the timezone offset
may be '+0000' or '-0000' or 'Z'. If the time is behind UTC, the timezone separator
is '-'. If the time is ahead of UTC the timezone separator is '+'.

Example: 10:27 p.m. in New York on 31 December 2000 would be expressed as 
"20001231T222700-0500" as New York is five hours behind UTC in winter. At
the 
 same moment in London, the date and time would be expressed as
"20010101T032700+0000" or as "20010101T032700Z" because in London it is
now 3:27 a.m. on 1 January 2001. At the same moment in Paris,the date and
time would be expressed as "20010101T042700+0100", because Paris is one hour
ahead of UTC
 in winter and it is now 4:27 a.m. on 1 January 2001.

================================= formalname ===================================

FormalName
==========
A string of characters whose meaning is determined by a controlled vocabulary.

Vocabulary
==========
The Vocabulary attribute, if present, provides a pointer to a TopicSet which is
the controlled vocabulary that can be used to resolve the meaning of the
FormalName. The value of the Vocabulary attribute is an http URL or a NewsML
URN, or the # character followed by the value of the Duid attribute of the a
TopicSet in the current document.

If there is no Vocabulary attribute, then the controlled vocabulary to be used
is located by the following algorithm:
- Proceed to the parent of the current element.
- If it has a Catalog element as its immediate child, see whether that Catalog
  contains a Resource element whose DefaultVocabularyFor child contains an XPath
  pattern that is matched by the current element. If so, then the controlled
  vocabulary is the resource identified by that Resource element.
- If the parent does not meet the above condition, proceed to its parent and
  check the same condition.
- Continue until a vocabulary is found, or no further parent elements are
  available because the root element has been reached and it too fails to meet
  the condition.

If there is no Vocabulary attribute and the above algorithm fails to identify
a resource that serves as the controlled vocabulary, there is an error, which
the NewsML system may signal to the user.

The NewsML system may also signal an error if a vocabulary is successfully
identified, but it contains no item that matches the value of the FormalName
whose meaning is sought.

Scheme
======
The Scheme attribute, if present, serves to distinguish which of possibly
multiple naming schemes in the controlled vocabulary is the one that governs
this FormalName. For a match to be obtained within the controlled vocabulary,
the rule is that the FormalName and the Scheme must both match. If there is a
Scheme attribute on the current element, then both the FormalName and the
Scheme in the controlled vocabulary must match.
The controlled vocabulary will be located either through the Vocabulary attribute 
(if present) or through the appropriate Catalog entry where the Context matches 
the current element.
 If a Vocabulary attribute is present that points to a TopicSet then the 
FormalName may be resolved using this TopicSet. This overrides any relevant 
Catalog entry.
If there is no Scheme attribute on the current element and no Vocabulary
attribute then a Scheme may be assigned through as follows:
 If the Catalog, within the instance or externally referenced from the instance,
 contains a Resource element with a DefaultVocabularyFor child element with a
Context attribute that matches the current element and a Scheme attribute with a 
value declared, then this Scheme may be applied when resolving the current 
element FormalName. If the DefaultVocabularyFor has no Scheme value then 
a match will be to an item in the vocabulary that has the current FormalName and
 no Scheme.

	<xs:attributeGroup name="localid">
		<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation> 
=================================== localid ====================================

Duid
====
Duid is a "Document-unique Identifier". It must satisfy the rules for XML ID
attributes: it must only contain name characters, and it must start with a 
name-start character (not a digit). Its value must be unique within any NewsML
document.

Every NewsML element type has Duid as an optional attribute. Combined with the
Identifier element, providing a value for the Duid of any element in a NewsML
document makes the element globally identifiable. The Identifier element gives
global identification to the document, and the Duid provides local
identification for the element within the document.

Euid
====
Euid is an "Element-unique Identifier". Its value must be unique among elements
of the same element-type and having the same parent element.

Use of Euid attribute makes it possible to identify any NewsML element within
the context of its local branch of the NewsML document tree. This makes it
possible to copy, or include by reference, subtrees into new combinations in
ways that would break the uniqueness of Duids (thereby forcing new Duids to be
allocated), but still being able to retain the identity of each element. If
Euids are maintained at every level, it is possible to identify, for example
"The ContentItem whose Euid is abc within the NewsComponent whose Euid is def".
Such identification patterns would be preserved even after "pruning and
grafting" of subtrees.

 ===================================== data =====================================
Where data is included, it may be directly in the form of a DataContent element,
or in the form of DataContent wrapped in an Encoding element, or by reference
through an Href attribute. In the latter case an empty Encoding element may be present.

================================ BasisForChoice ================================
The content of this element is an XPath statement or element-type name
identifying information within each NewsComponent or ContentItem that can be
used as a basis for choice between equivalent NewsComponents or ContentItems.
If the XPath pattern begins with a . character, this represents the 'root' of
the XPath and corresponds to the NewsComponent or ContentItem itself. By
applying the XPath pattern to each NewsComponent or ContentItem in turn within
the set of equivalents, the system can extrac the data on the basis of which a
choice between the items can be made. If multiple matches to the XPath pattern
are present within the subtree that begins at the 'root', only the first match
found in document order is significant.  The optional Rank attribute allows
providers to place a numerical order on the
 importance they think should be
attached to the different bases for choice.
 Smaller numbers represent higher
importance.

A container for Resource and TopicUse elements. Resource elements map URNs to
URLs and indicate default vocabularies which apply to the formal names of
certain elements within the subtree that begins with the immediate parent of
the Catalog element. TopicUse elements indicate where in the NewsML document
certain Topics are used. The optional Href attribute provides a pointer to
a Catalog element elsewhere in this or another document. Its value consists of
a # character followed by the value of the Duid attribute of the referenced
Catalog element and preceded, if the referenced Catalog is not in the current
document, by an http URL or a NewsML URN identifying the document or NewsItem
in which the Catalog appears. If the Href attribute is present on a Catalog
element, then that element should be empty. If it contains subelements, the
NewsML system may signal an error.

============================ DefaultVocabularyFor ==============================
An indication that the parent Resource provides the default vocabulary that
determines the meanings and permitted values of the data occurring in a
particular part of a NewsML document subtree. The Context attribute is an
XPath pattern identifying the data to which the default vocabulary applies.
If the XPath pattern is one that matches elements, then it is the value of the
FormalName attribute of that element that is designated. If the XPath pattern
is one that matches attributes, then it is the value of that attribute itself
that is designated. The optional Scheme attribute identifies the relevant naming
scheme if the Resource contains more than one naming scheme. If the Resource is
a NewsML TopicSet, then the meaning of the data identified by the Context is
provided by the Topic whose FormalName subelement matches that data. If the
Resource is not a NewsML TopicSet, then the way in which it is interpreted in
order to provide a meaning for the data is not defined by NewsML but by the
authority that governs whatever format the Resource uses.

A property of a NewsItem, NewsComponent, ContentItem, Topic, Location or Party. The property has a 
name and either  a simple Value or a complex value consisting of a set of further properties.
The property has a name and either  a simple Value or a complex value consisting of a set of
further properties.

Value
=====
A string representation of the value of a Property.

ValueRef
========
A pointer to the value of the Property. This might be a Topic in a TopicSet, or
any other piece of data. If both Value and ValueRef are provided, then ValueRef
identifies the actual value of the property, with Value simply providing a
string representation or mnemonic for it.


AllowedValues
=============
The AllowedValues attribute, if present, is a pointer to a controlled vocabulary
that delimits the set of allowed values for the property. This may be an http
URL, or a NewsML URN, or a fragment identifier consisting of a # charactger
followed by the Duid of an element in the current document. The pointer must
reference either a Resource element that designates an external controlled
vocabulary, or a TopicSet element, that is itself the controlled vocabulary.

AllowedScheme (added in Version 1.1)
=============
The AllowedScheme attribute, if present, distinguishes the Scheme in a controlled
vocabulary that delimits the set of allowed values for the property. For a match to be 
obtained within the controlled vocabulary both the AllowedScheme  must match the 
Scheme in the vocabulary and the Value must match the FormalName in the vocabulary. 
The use of the AllowedScheme attribute serves to indicate that the Value data is
 drawn from a controlled vocabulary rather that being an uncontrolled entry.

=============================== PublicIdentifier ===============================
A public identifier (in the sense defined by the XML 1,0 Specification) for a

urn:newsml:{ProviderId}:{DateId}:{NewsItemId}:{RevisionId}{RevisionId@Update}

where {x} means "the content of the x subelement of the NewsIdentifier" and
{x@y} means "the value of the y attribute of the x subelement of the
NewsIdentifier", with the exception that if the Update attribute of the
RevisionId element has its default value of N, it is omitted from the URN.

Note that the set of characters that can be directly included within a URN 
is limited.  The allowed characters are specified by the Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF) in its Request For Comments (RFC) number 2141.  
This document is available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt.  
Any character that is not within the permitted URN character set must be 
converted to a sequence of legal characters as described in RFC 2141.

Note that the existence of this URN enables the NewsItem to be referenced
unambiguously by pointers from other XML elements or resources. Within such
pointers, if the RevisionId, its preceding : character and its following Update
qualifier are omitted, then the pointer designates the most recent revision at
the time it is resolved. Version 1.1.2 Pattern corrected for Date component

A pointer to a TopicSet that is to be merged with the current one. The TopicSet
attribute is a pointer to the relevant TopicSet. Its value can be an http URL,
or a NewsML URN as described in the comment to PublicIdentifier, or a fragment
identifier consisting of a # character followed by the Duid of a TopicSet in the
current document. The presence of a TopicSetRef child in a TopicSet has the
effect that all the Topics in the referenced TopicSet are included by reference
within the current TopicSet. When this merging results in there exising two
FormalName grandchildren of the same TopicSet that have the same content and
the same Scheme attribute value, then the Topics whose children are in fact the
same topic, and are deemed to be merged. The merging of Topics need not be
performed physically by the system, but the meaning of the data is
exactly the same as if the merging were actually performed. Merging two
Topcis consists of creating a single Topic that contains all the children of
both, and eliminating duplicates.

attribute should be provided to distinguish the second transmission from the
first. The form that the value of the Repeat attribute takes is determined by
the provider. Likewise, the format for the TransmissionId itself is for the
provider to decide. It could for example consist of a channel identifier
followed by a sequence number.
