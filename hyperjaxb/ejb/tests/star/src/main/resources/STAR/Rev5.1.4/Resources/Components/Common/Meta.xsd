 =================================================================================================================
 DC     20070208     CR296          Updated to OAGI 9.0, leverage use of OAGi 9.1 verbs instead of STAR Verbs.
 MV     20070321     CR366          Added Show Verb
 DC     20070514     CR352          Added NounCountNumeric to SenderType for GM request
 DC     20070529     MT277          Propose Verb as required by Nav International.
 DC     20070706     MT299          Deprecated versionID.   Use revisionID to identify the particular BOD version
                                    based on the repository.   All BODs in the STAR 5 repository are required to
                                    be forwards compatible, meaning that a STAR 5.0 BOD can validate against a
                                    STAR 5.1 schema.
 MV     20070822     MT401          BUG FIX: Added bulleted points to ReferenceID from original MS Word Guidelines.
 DC     20071213     MT510          Updated documentation of versionID so that it says to use releaseID to determine
                                    the version.

                in a publish scenario, where it pushes information to other applications based on a
                business event.Although BODs based on this verb do not commonly cause updates to

            <xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/9.0">The Get verb is to communicate to a business software component a request for an existing piece of information to be returned. The Get may be paired with most of the nouns defined in the OAGIS specification.The response to this request is the Show verb. The behavior of a BOD with a Get verb is quite predictable across most of the nouns it may be paired with.The Get is designed to retrieve a single piece of information by using that information's primary retrieval field, or key field. The Get verb is not used to request several documents at once. The GetList verb is designed to achieve that purpose and will be covered in more detail later.Selection Criteria:There are two types of selection capabilities for most BOD's that use the Get verb.1) The first selection capability is called Field-Based Selection. Within a Get-based Business Object Document, the first Data Type that occurs in a specific BOD structure is commonly used to provide the Field-Based Selection criteria. This is always defined within the specific BOD and is commonly the required fields for that specific Data type.The Field-Based Selection enables the requester to provide a value or values (in the case of multiple required Field Identifiers), in the required fields. Then the responding component uses those values to find and return the requested information to the originating business software component.2) The second type of selection capability for Get-based BODs is called Data Type Selection. Data Type selection enables the requester to identify which Data Types within the noun are requested to be returned in the response. The use of this capability is described for each corresponding Data Type for all BODs that use the Get verb. The Data Types are identified for retrieval within the Get instance of a BOD by including the name of the Data Type in the meta data but without any Field Identifiers or Segments identified within the Data Type. This will signify to the responding application that all of the data that corresponds to that Data Type is to be included in the response.If the Data Type is not requested, the Data Type identifier is not included in the Get request and this will signify to the responding component that the Data Type is not to be returned.</xsd:documentation>

            <xsd:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis/9.0">In an effort to simpilify the usage of the verbs the GetList verb is being depricated as of OAGIS 9.0, the GetList will still be provided for the next three releases at which time it is scheduled to be removed from OAGIS. As such for all new development we recommend that you use the Get verb which may serve the same function of the GetList verb has in the past. The purpose of the GetList verb is to enable a business software component to request summary information for one or more occurrences of a specific noun from another business software component. The GetList may be paired with most of the nouns in the OAGIS specification.The response to this request is a BOD using the List verb. The GetList is designed to retrieve multiple occurrences of data such as all of the sales orders or all of the purchase orders within a requested range. It does not require an exact match of the key fields in order to retrieve information. It may use a range selection criteria with a "from" and "to" selection capability. This behavior is quite different from the Get verb, which is designed to retrieve a specific noun using a specific key field.The GetList verb also enables the retrieval of information across several documents by using selection fields. An example of this could be requesting all sales order lines for a specific item. This type of functionality is limited to the capabilities of the responding application and needs to be determined during the implementation project. More details on this capability will be described below. GetList attributes: o maxitems attribute is a number that indicates the number of maximum items to be returned. o rssave attribute is a Boolean flag that indicates whether the result set should be saved on the sending system if maxitems is exceeded. o rsstart attribute is a number of the starting record for the next section of the result set. If it is omitted, it is to be assumed the first of the maxitems. o rsref attribute is a string that represents the implementation-specific result set identifier for subsequent requests. Selection Criteria: There are two types of selection capabilities enabled by the BODs that use the GetList verb. 1) Field-Based Selection Allows the requesting system to ask for information that matches the data provided. It also allows the requestor to indicate the information that to be returned by specifying the ReturnCriteria indicated on the GetList Verb. 2) Range Selection Allows the requesting system to provide a range of values for known data. This is accomplished by providing two occurances of the Noun. The first occurance indicates the "From" the second occurance indicates the "To" occurance. Again the requestor can indicate the information that to be returned by specifying the ReturnCriteria indicated on the GetList Verb.</xsd:documentation>

As such for all new development we recommend that you use the Show verb which may serve the same function of the List verb has in the past. The purpose of the List verb is to enable a business software component to respond to a GetList request or to proactively send a listing of summary information containing many instances of occurrences of data for a noun to one or more other business software components.The results of a List may then be used as is, or they may be used to select a specific instance of a document or entity in order to issue a detail Get request.Although BODs based on this verb do not commonly cause updates to occur, there may be times when the component receiving the List decides to use the information it receives to update. This is entirely the decision of the receiving software component and is not forbidden.The behavior of the List verb is quite straight forward with a few exceptions. The List response to any GetList request needs to read the request carefully to ensure the response is returning the requested Data Types. The List needs to ensure the response to the GetList does not exceed the maxItems value.The List needs to find the specific Field Identifiers that are used for the Field-Based Selection or Range-Based Selection and process them accordingly. The attributes associated with the List BODs are as follows: o rsstart attribute is a number that idicates the starting record for the section of the resulting set returned in the list message. This value should always match the rsstart value in the originating GetList BOD. o rscount attribute is a number that indicates the number of records returned in the message. The subsequent request for additional records should have a rsstart value of rscount + 1. o rstotal attribute is a number that indicates the total number of records in the result set. o rscomplete attribute is a Boolean that indicates that the list provided exhaust the possible values. o rsref attribute is a string that represents the implementation-specific result set identifier for subsequent requests.</xsd:documentation>

The Create verb is used to describe specific processing in a more fine grained manner beyond add, change or delete processing. This is generally used when the processing is initiating the building of a document, rather than moving a document from one system to another. Examples of this include Create PRODORDER and Create BOM. In these cases, the documents have not been constructed and need to be. This differs from the Add PO or Add REQUISITN processing as those requests refer to a document that has already been established and the document is being communicated to another business application.</xsd:documentation>

The business oriented word is used instead of the data processing term for the sake of clarity.</xsd:documentation>

                                returned, given a Get query success or the response from the
                                Process. In essence, the expression here has the effect of filtering
                                the part(s) of the found element(s) that are to be returned.
                                ReturnCriteria plays no role in the query itself or the process.
                                That is handled as a match against the request BOD's noun exemplar.
                                ReturnCriteria allows the sender of the BOD to indicate which
                                information (down to the field level) is requested to be returned,
                                given that the query has been successful in matching the exemplar to
                                existing nouns. That is, in a GetListPurchaseOrder, if one or more
                                PurchaseOrders with a TotalPrice = $1M were found, ReturnCriteria
                                tells the BOD recipient which parts of the PurchaseOrder should be
                                populated with content when the response (ShowPurchaseOrder) is
                                formulated. The expressionLanguage indicates the expression language
                                being used. In order for the ReturnCriteria expression to be
                                evaluable by the BOD recipient, the recipient must be capable of
                                processing and interpreting the specified expression language. XPath
                                is the default, due to its ubiquity among XML processing
                                technologies. </xsd:documentation>

                Notify is used to inform the receiving party that an
                event has occurred or document has been created. For
                example, a supplier may have a proposed order that is
                sent to a trading partner. The noun will contain the
                data that has been proposed. An optional ConfirmBOD can
                be sent as a response.
