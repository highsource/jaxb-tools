# Empty jaxb2-basics-runtime

This is an empty jar to override
`org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons:jaxb2-basics-runtime` versions below v2
when you have both `org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons:jaxb2-basics-runtime` and
`org.jvnet.jaxb:jaxb2-basics-runtime` artifacts in the same application.

See https://github.com/highsource/jaxb-tools/issues/465
